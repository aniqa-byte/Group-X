Description:
An application with an interface representative of a library, where the primary purpose of the application is to ensure that users have the ability to access stored information on a database; e-books and audiobooks. And this is achieved once their created membership account has been read by the verification elements of the application, effectively granting the user an updated access to their selected storage of information, with such updated access to the database content deleted upon the termination of a predefined time-limit. Where, the facilitated retrieval of stored information by the user originates from a created collection of predefined media format files on the database, that have modifiable categoric attributes, such as: format, genre, or author. And such media files, other than limited sample segments, are not available to users without the correct updated access granted through membership, as can the media files and user accounts be entirely removed from the database.
